pa_occ.R contains the script to summarise the occupancy model outputs and produce the figures, including:

Species richness  
Species trends  
Temporal beta diversity  
ROBITT assessment of data  

launch_example.R contains an example script to create the objects and model specifications needed to run the occupancy models (i.e., occupancy model code) in a high-performance computing environment (e.g., https://jasmin.ac.uk/).
